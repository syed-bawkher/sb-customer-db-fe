## **Building the Front-End**

1. I had decided to build the front end using vanilla ReactJS over something like NextJS for more control over the application rather than using a framework. 
2. The frontend was mocked up with the client and the users of the software to meet usability requests. 
3. Along with postman testing the front-end was also tested and more endpoints were made parallel to the frontend being developed for better feature integration. 
4. The application was built to handle future feature development, while consulting the users of the system. more features can now be quickly added and tested. 
5. this way a stock management system has been setup with the application along with the order and customer management software to have this software track stock items efficiently.
